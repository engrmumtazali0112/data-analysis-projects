# 🚀 Data Analysis Projects

I'm thrilled to share my collection of **Data Analysis Projects**, where I explored real-world datasets to uncover insights and build predictive models. These projects showcase my skills in **data cleaning**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **visualization**, and **machine learning techniques**.
