## Projects

### 1. Distribution Visualization
- **Description:** Visualize the distribution of categorical or continuous variables using bar charts or histograms.
- **Objective:** Analyze the age or gender distribution in a population to identify trends.
- **Dataset:** Custom or publicly available population data.
- **Key Techniques:** Data visualization with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

### 2. Titanic Dataset Analysis
- **Description:** Perform data cleaning and EDA on the Titanic dataset.
- **Objective:** Explore relationships between variables such as survival rate, gender, class, and age.
- **Dataset:** [Titanic Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).
- **Key Techniques:** Data cleaning, handling missing values, and visualizing trends.

### 3. Predictive Modeling with Decision Tree Classifier
- **Description:** Build a decision tree classifier to predict customer purchase behavior.
- **Objective:** Use demographic and behavioral data to predict product purchases.
- **Dataset:** [Bank Marketing Dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing).
- **Key Techniques:** Machine learning with `scikit-learn`, decision tree visualization, and feature importance analysis.

### 4. Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Data
- **Description:** Analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data.
- **Objective:** Understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands.
- **Dataset:** Custom or publicly available datasets, such as Twitter sentiment data.
- **Key Techniques:** Natural language processing (NLP), sentiment analysis, and text visualization.

### 5. Traffic Accident Data Analysis
- **Description:** Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day.
- **Objective:** Visualize accident hotspots and determine contributing factors.
- **Dataset:** Publicly available traffic accident datasets, such as those from local government agencies.
- **Key Techniques:** Geospatial analysis, data visualization, and clustering.
